# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LAB TASKS 

## Problem Statement – 1: 
Your new software project is a product delivery platform. As a part of project initiation and approval you are required to perform and note down a thorough competitor analysis. (Some companies with a product delivery platform are Unbxd, Algolia etc.)  

After your analysis, you are expected to do the following exercise as a part of risk management. 

On the digital document or paper, add columns with the following headers: 
* What could cause a miss in your deadline?
* What will keep your project on time?
* What does this project need that you don’t have?
* What do you already have that this project needs?
* What are you worried about?
* What are you excited about?
* What could go wrong with this project?
* What could go right with this project? 

Brainstorm and write down answers for these questions first. Next, mention the points that you feel are going to be risks and successes. 
(Hint: To identify successes, ask yourself this question – “What’s the opposite of this risk?”)
