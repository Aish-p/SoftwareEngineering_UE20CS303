# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING LAB TASKS 

## Problem Statement – 1: Unit Testing 
A unit is the smallest block of code that functions individually. The first level of testing is Unit testing and this problem statement is geared towards the same.  

• Discuss with your teammates and demarcate units in your code base 

Note: discuss why the code snippet you have chosen can be classified as a unit  

• Develop test cases for both valid and invalid data

• Ideate how you could further modularize larger blocks of code into compact units with your teammates  


## Problem Statement – 2: Dynamic Testing 
Dynamic testing involves execution of your code to analyse errors found during execution. Some common techniques are Boundary Value Analysis and Mutation Testing.  

### Problem Statement – 2.a: Boundary Value Analysis  
When it comes to finding errors in your code base, they are often found at locations where a condition is being tested. Due to this, developers often use Boundary Value tests to reduce defect density.  

• How would you define a boundary test?  

o Note: Simple relational conditions are a basic example  

• Build your boundary test cases and execute them  

### Problem Statement – 2.b: Mutation Testing 
• Using your isolated units from the first problem statement, ideate with your team mates on how to mutate the code  

• Develop at least 3 mutants of the functioning code and test all 4 code bases using the test case from the first problem statement  


## Problem Statement – 3: Static Testing 
Static testing involves validating your code without any execution. Under this problem statement, you will be expected to analyse and calculate the cyclomatic complexity of your code.  

• Using the unit you selected in the first problem statement as an example, develop the control flow graph of your problem statement.  

• Using the Control flow graph, calculate the cyclomatic complexity of your code.  

• Using the cyclomatic complexity as an indicator, Ideate and code your unit again to reduce complexity  


## Problem Statement – 4: Acceptance Testing 
Assume your neighbouring team is the client for your code. Give them an idea of what your product is and the software requirements for the product.  

• Exchange your code base and test each others projects to see if it meets user requirements  

• If you identify a bug in the project you are testing, inform the opposing team of the bug  

• As  a team, based in clients experience, ideate modifications to the existing project that could improve client experience  


## Problem Statement – 5: Maintenance Activities  
Once a product is completed, it is handed off to a service based company to ensure all maintenance activities are performed without the added expenditure of skilled developers. However, a few tasks are performed by the maintenance team to gauge the product better. In this problem statement, you will be asked to experiment with your code.  

• Exchange code bases with your neighboring teams and reverse engineer a block of code in order to understand it’s functionality  

• After understanding the code block, Re-Engineer the code 
o Ideate how to refactor the code and the portion of the code base you would have to change  
o Discuss how the new changes would impact the time and space complexity of the project during execution  

• After Reverse Engineering and Re-Engineering the code, perform acceptance testing between the teams
